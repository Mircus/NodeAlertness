This is some basic Python code to illustrate the main concepts of  Node Alertness approach to detecting changes in evolving large scale graphs, originally presented at the ForecastNYC conference in NYC. 

The Notebook is for doing Node Alertness in Spark (PS There is some bug calculating cointegration, probably due to NAN values)
